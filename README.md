# hashDictionary

A dictionary of words is given as a first argument (filename) in the program. This input file is the simple text file "Dictionary.txt", where each line is a word (see Files section). 

The program asks the user to enter a word. The program then responds with “True” if the word exists in the dictionary and with “False” otherwise. It will also ask if the user would like to add said word to the Dictionary. If "True", the program must suggest words (from Dictionary) starting with the same first two letters. At the end of each suggestion the exec. time (in micro-sec) must be displayed (see "TimeInterval.h" in Files section)
